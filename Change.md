### 2018/11/15
#### Add files
- add `API.md`,`Notification.md`,`Change.md`
- add `workflow流程图草稿.pdf`
- some sql scripts and code files

#### Database
- move file:`table_details_1-8.xlsx`,`table_details_9-18.xlsx`,`table_details_19-25.xlsx` to `table_details_part` folder,and create the `table_details_all.xlsx` file for convenience which contains all tables
- move sql scripts from `powerdesigner_work` to the new folder `sql_script`,also I have add new scripts.They are `Procedures.sql`,`add_views.sql`
- for `table recommend_people`, we add the column `rp_vali` to tell if this recommend person is still valid now(e.g. when the person accept our offer,this record is no longer valid)
- we add the table `recruitment_requirement_stage` to and the column `rr_sta_id` in table `recruitment_requirement` to tell the stage the recruitement in
- add two views,see the file `table_details_all.xlsx` if you'll need it
- for most tables,I have set their key column to `identity`.That means you don't have to provide values for them,they all auto-generated by adding 1 from base on the key column of pervious record. E.g. to create a new record for table recommend_stage,I should use `insert into recommend_stage values(id,'blabla...')`,now: `insert into recommend_stage values('blabla...')`
- samples are also updated
- actually,many things are changed,so **delete your database and rerun all the sql scripts to recreate your database** to ensure you database is newest

#### Pages
- add some pages I have finished,see API.md for the parameters they accept
- I have provide many Error Pages in `ErrorPage` folder,they should be used with `ienum.eErrorEnum`,use `Find Usage` to see how they're used.

#### JAVA API
- CommenConnecct
	+ add trim process for `singleResultQuery` and `singleLineQuery`
	+ add new method `existQuery`,which only judge if there is any record accord with your query
- see the folder ienum,there many useful enum classes in it.Use `Find Usage(Alt+F7)` in IDEA to see how it save your time and at the same time provide better maintainability
- `util.iutil` provide a java implement of `range` function in Python.Maybe you'll need it.
- `table.TableBase` is exciting.It allows you to create HTML table fastly(May be only 3 lines of code).See some simple usage in `example.TableBaseExample.java`.You can explore its code for more details.**For more complicated conditions**,you should also create you own **subclass** to cope with them.
- Java bean `LoginUser` is perfected.**When login,you need to create a LoginUser object,fill these info and save it into session(attri name is "user")**
